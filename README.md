# SUPER HOT GOOGLE EXTENSION

- A google extension where TIME MOVES ONLY WHEN YOU MOVE
- the goal is to find out how to stop the animations in webpage as much as possible

### Suggestion website to experience
https://mailbakery.com/blog/25-wonderful-examples-of-animated-gifs-in-email-marketing-templates/

### Finished
- pause and start simple gif
- pause and start youtube video

### In progress / might not know how to do:
- toggle the function in the popup instead of disabling it everytime
- pause and start css animation
- make a lovely icon for this extension
- more possibilities for website to move around

### Problem discovered:
- Some that are not css animation or standard video format could be difficult to pause
- Starting time could be slow considering it needs to check everything when initializing it
- New element for webpage might not work if I don't try to update it
- Pages that have hidden gif image might not work
- Many problems like this extension don't actually work at all

### Suggestion:
- Disable this extension when you are working seriously 

### Demo:
- Will do it later
